# Finance
This project was basically to create a simple webpage which would give the status of the ETFs in my Acorns account along with a graph to accompany them. This project was slightly problematic because I tried it without looking into what Javascript was, so it basically works by using static webpage tools (HTML, CSS) and periodically updating them with a Python script that would regenerate the HTML file with new data. So, kind of a dumb way of storing data, but overall a decent basic webpage and unintentionally cool and interesting proof of concept project. As of now, there are no plans to update or refactor this project.
